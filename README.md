# A Sorted Tale

This is an imaginary bookshop called “A Sorted Tale”. Every morning, the owner decides to sort the books in a new way.

Some of his favorite methods include:

By author name
By title
By number of characters in the title
By the reverse of the author’s name
Throughout the day, patrons of the bookshop remove books from the shelf. Given the strange ordering of the store, they do not always get the books placed back in exactly the correct location.

The owner wants me to research methods of fixing the book ordering throughout the day and sorting the books in the morning. It is currently taking too long!
